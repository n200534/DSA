## 📚 Sections

### 📘 [Learn Basics](./Learn%20Basics)
Foundational topics from Striver’s A2Z Sheet:
- Patterns using loops 
- Basic Math problems
- Basic Recursion and Backtracking
- Basic Hashing

### 🔁 [Learn Sorting Techniques](./Sorting)
Core sorting algorithms covered in this section:
- **Selection Sort** – Select the minimum element and place it at the beginning, iteratively.
- **Bubble Sort** – Repeatedly swap adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- **Insertion Sort** – Build the sorted array one item at a time by inserting elements at the correct position.
- **Quick Sort** – Divide and conquer algorithm using a pivot to partition and recursively sort sub-arrays.
- **Merge Sort** – Divide the array into halves, recursively sort them, and merge the sorted halves.
