# üêç DSA with Python ‚Äì Build Logic, Not Just Code

Welcome to the **DSA with Python** repository! This project is a personal journey to master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Python ‚Äî starting with **pattern problems**, the best way to build your logical thinking and looping skills.

> ‚ÄúIf you can master patterns, you can master loops. And if you can master loops, you‚Äôre halfway into problem solving.‚Äù

## üß† How to Approach Pattern Problems

Pattern problems are more than just printing shapes ‚Äî they teach you how to break a problem down, think row-by-row, and develop code that evolves over iterations. Here's the general approach you should follow:

### ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Pattern Solving Strategy

1. **Observe the Pattern Carefully**
   - Identify how many rows and columns are there.
   - Check what's changing: numbers, alphabets, stars, or spaces.
   - Look for symmetry: pyramid, diamond, inverted shapes, etc.

2. **Break it Row-wise**
   - Ask: what needs to be printed on each row?
   - Can you express it with a loop from `0 to n-1` or `1 to n`?

3. **Use Nested Loops**
   - Outer loop for rows.
   - Inner loops for spaces and/or characters.

4. **Use ASCII for Character Patterns**
   - Use `chr()` and `ord()` to print characters dynamically.
     ```python
     chr(65 + j)  # prints A, B, C...
     ```

5. **Use Math Where Necessary**
   - For palindromic or mirrored patterns, calculate midpoints.
     ```python
     midpoint = (2 * i + 1) // 2
     ```

6. **Dry Run for Small Inputs**
   - Try `n = 3` or `4` and see if your logic works line-by-line.

7. **Name Your Files by Type**
   - Group patterns by types for better understanding: numbers, stars, alphabets, mixed.
