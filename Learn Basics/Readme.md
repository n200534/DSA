# ‚≠ê How to Approach Pattern Problems in Python

Pattern problems are excellent for building logic with loops and nested conditions. They might look simple, but they sharpen your understanding of how iterations and indices work.

## ‚úÖ Points to Remember

1. **Patterns = Rows √ó Columns**
   - Always visualize your pattern in terms of a grid.
   - Rows ‚Üí Outer loop  
   - Columns ‚Üí Inner loop(s)

2. **Dry Run on Paper First**
   - For `n = 3` or `n = 4`, write down expected output.
   - Understand how spaces, characters, and numbers change.

3. **Differentiate Between These Components:**
   - **Spaces**: Used for alignment (especially in pyramids).
   - **Characters/Numbers**: Vary based on row and column.
   - **Mirrored/Palindromic**: Often have two symmetrical parts.

4. **Patterns are Often a Combination**
   - Left triangle + Right triangle
   - Numbers + Spaces + Symbols
   - Increasing + Decreasing sequences

5. **Characters & ASCII**
   - Use `ord('A')` to get ASCII value, and `chr(65)` to get character.
   - Use this to handle A-Z patterns dynamically.

## üß† Step-by-Step Approach to Solve Any Pattern

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Understand the Number of Rows
- Usually given as `n`.
- Outer loop will run from `0 to n-1` or `1 to n`.

```python
for i in range(n):  # or range(1, n+1)
