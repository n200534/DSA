# ‚≠ê How to Approach Pattern Problems in Python

Pattern problems are excellent for building logic with loops and nested conditions. They might look simple, but they sharpen your understanding of how iterations and indices work.

---

## ‚úÖ Points to Remember

1. **Patterns = Rows √ó Columns**
   - Always visualize your pattern in terms of a grid.
   - Rows ‚Üí Outer loop  
   - Columns ‚Üí Inner loop(s)

2. **Dry Run on Paper First**
   - For `n = 3` or `n = 4`, write down expected output.
   - Understand how spaces, characters, and numbers change.

3. **Differentiate Between These Components:**
   - **Spaces**: Used for alignment (especially in pyramids).
   - **Characters/Numbers**: Vary based on row and column.
   - **Mirrored/Palindromic**: Often have two symmetrical parts.

4. **Patterns are Often a Combination**
   - Left triangle + Right triangle
   - Numbers + Spaces + Symbols
   - Increasing + Decreasing sequences

5. **Characters & ASCII**
   - Use `ord('A')` to get ASCII value, and `chr(65)` to get character.
   - Use this to handle A-Z patterns dynamically.

## üß† Step-by-Step Approach to Solve Any Pattern

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Understand the Number of Rows
- Usually given as `n`.
- Outer loop will run from `0 to n-1` or `1 to n`.

```python
for i in range(n):  # or range(1, n+1)
```
# üß† Approach to Solving Pattern Problems

Pattern problems are logic-building exercises involving loops and conditionals. Below is a structured approach you should follow when solving any pattern problem.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Analyze the Row Content

- What are we printing in each row?
- Is it a fixed number of characters, or does it change based on the row number?

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Break Down the Row Into Parts

Each row might consist of:

- **Spaces** (for alignment)
- **Symbols / Numbers / Characters** (printable pattern)
- **Symmetrical parts** (like mirrored halves or palindromes)

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Build Inner Loops for Each Component

```python
# Example: Pyramid with stars
n = 5
for i in range(n):
    print(" " * (n - i - 1), end="")     # leading spaces
    print("*" * (2 * i + 1), end="")     # stars
    print()                              # new line
```
## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Verify for Small n and Adjust
Test your code for small inputs like n = 3, n = 5

Check:

- Alignment

- Symmetry

- Correct number of characters

# üìò Basic Math Problems ‚Äì DSA with Python

This section covers foundational math-based problems from the Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet. Each problem is implemented in Python with optimized logic and clean structure.

## ‚úÖ Solved Problems

- Count digits in a number
- Reverse a number
- Check if a number is a palindrome
- Compute GCD/HCF of two numbers
- Check for Armstrong number
- Print all divisors of a number
- Check for a prime number

---

## üß† General Approach & Key Points

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Count Digits
- Keep dividing `n` by 10 until it becomes 0.
- Increment a counter at each step.
- Time Complexity: **O(log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ n)**

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Reverse a Number
- Use `% 10` to get the last digit and build the reversed number.
- Remove the last digit using `// 10`.
- Time Complexity: **O(log n)**

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Palindrome Check
- Store original number.
- Reverse it and compare with original.
- If both match, it's a palindrome.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ GCD / HCF
- Use **Euclidean Algorithm**:
- Time Complexity: **O(log min(a, b))**

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Armstrong Number
- Count digits ‚Üí `num_digits = len(str(n))`
- For each digit: sum += digit‚Åø
- Compare sum with original number.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Print All Divisors
- Loop from 1 to ‚àön, and for each i that divides n:
- Print both i and n // i.
- Time Complexity: **O(‚àön)**

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Check for Prime Number
- Prime numbers have no divisors other than 1 and itself.
- Check for factors from 2 to ‚àön.
- Return `False` if any factor found, else `True`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Best Practices

- Use `//` for integer division.
- Use `math.sqrt(n)` or `int(n ** 0.5)` for optimized loops.
- Always handle edge cases: `n = 0`, `n = 1`, `n < 0`
- Dry run your logic with small numbers to debug patterns.
